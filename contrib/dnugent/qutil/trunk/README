== ABOUT ==

qutil provides several different common utility
functionalities for use with Q programs.  These currently include:

* an option parsing facility as an alternative to .Q.opt
* a file loading facility based on a pathlist and supporting
  version numbers

== INSTALLATION == 

Unzip qutil to whichever location you desire.

If you plan on using the file loading facility you must add
the code in q.q to your Q installation's q.q

You can customize the environment variable used for the library
search path by changing the argument passed to that function
(it is defaults to $QPATH). This will cause the file
qutil/lib/bootstrap.q to be loaded and will expose the file
loading functions.  The paths in the environment variable
should be separated by colons.

please contribute them back.  If you have suggestions,
please make them.  If you have found a bug, please report
