To use the bootstrap functionality which provides some basic utilities (initially file requiring), append the contents of q.q to your own q.q.  You can customize the environment variable used for the library search path by changing the argument passed to that function (it is defaulted to `QPATH).  This adds the function .u.require, which can be used to load any files or packages in the search paths).
