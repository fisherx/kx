I found the `base' files at:
ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/20.7/

And picked up the `latest' version:
emacs-20.7-fullbin-i386.tar.tz

WinZip 8.0 does un-GZipping as well as un-Taring. No fussing with `MSDOS' is needed, nor with GZip or TAR

Unzipped to D:\Program Files\EMacs
It created \emacs-20.7 below this

Click on addpm.exe in the `bin' subdirectory it creates an Icon that can be right-dragged to desktop
(Create shortcut here)

Target line -font fixedsys was unbelieveably ugly on my machine
so I didn't use it and I much prefer to edit the `target' line by adding:
-bg wheat -fg dimgrey -cr red     

Remove the (setq process-encoding-system-alist ...) from the
instructions to be placed in C:\.emacs  It is apparently a hack that
is not needed in 20.7 and later.  

Saving the .emacs file under that name proved to impossible where I was in ME,
so I saved it under a different name and then went to a DOS box to rename it.
That worked fine.
        
I did all of the above on my new machine which (temporarily, I hope) has Windows ME on it.
I guess we can thank MicroSoft for giving us yet another operating systems, seemingly differing
from its predecessors _only_ AFAICS in that it has more bugs, such that the above may
differ somewhat on 9x, 2k, or NT boxes. Who knows?  (or cares, for that matter).
