Here is my shot at the shortest Emacs tutorial!

Getting started
===============

0. Intall emacs per the attached instructions.
1. Install the attached .emacs file per the same instructions.
2. Set up a directory in Explorer "c:\temp\crapdir\".
3. Create two .k files "c:\temp\crapdir\crap1.k, crap2.k".
4. Cut a 3/4 inch by 12 inch piece of paper.
   Scotch tape it just over your f keys.
   Write the following notes over the specified f-keys.
   f1  = GoTo Line
   f2  = Find File
   f3  = Save File
   f4  = Bury Buffer
   f5  = Undo
   f6  = Fund Mode
   f7  = Beg Of Line
   f8  = End Of Line
   f9  = Split Screen
   f10 = UnSplit Screen
   f11 = Cursor Focus Switch
   f12 = Last Buffer Switch

Learning Emacs Editor
=====================

5. Execute emacs by double clicking on the icon.
6. When emacs comes up, press f2.
7. The "minibuffer" on the bottom will prompt you for a file.
   Enter c:\temp\cra
   and press space bar.  Emacs will complete crapdir for you.
   Press enter.
   Emacs will show you all the files in that dir (there are two).
8. Click on or slightly to the left or right of file crap1.k.
   Press the letter "f".
   You will now open a "buffer" to edit crap1.k.
9. Use the mouse or arrow keys to move around.
   Type over or insert based on your keyboard's insert/overwrite setting.
   Copy by click, hold, drag, release.
   Paste by middlemouse (if you have an intellimouse or you're on Unix).
   Else pulldown Edit on the taskbar and choose Paste.
   Else just do ctl-y (for "yank" it out of the copy buffer).
   Ctl-w is copy AND cut in one action.
10. Block copies work as easily as a few characters.
11. To save your changes press f3.
    When you are prompted for a file name, press enter to save
    over the file you started with OR enter a new name.
12. If you make a mistake (or mistakes), press undo repeatedly
    until you are in an acceptable state.
12. To open another buffer, press f9.
    To make the new buffer other that the default HALF size, drag the 
    separator bar.
13. To cycle the cursor's focus either mouse click or f4 or f11 or f12.
    Observe the subtle differences between these options.
14. To return to "full screen" on the buffer with focus, press f10.
15. To create a new file, press f2 and enter a new name.
16. If you are at a minibuffer prompt that you don't want to answer,
    press ctl-g to escape.
17. To find text, press ctl-s for search.  Enter target text at prompt.
    To search in reverse, press ctl-r.
    Repeated keystrokes find more occurances.
18. To kill one of the buffers, press ctl-x-k.  You will be warned if
    your edit has not yet been saved.
19. At any point on a line, ctl-k kills to the right.

Learning Emacs Console
======================

19. Type alt-x shell and press enter.
    This starts an OS shell.  Your current directory will be the
    one you "started in" in the icon.
20. You can execute any OS command.
21. Type K to get into K.
22. Enter some line of K (like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) and press enter.
23. With the arrow key or mouse, go up to the line and press enter.
    You just re-executed that line immediately.  This also works on results!
24. Go up to the line with the mouse and click ANYWHERE along the line.
    NOW right click.
    You just brought part or all of the line down to be edited.
    Edit it and press enter to execute it.
25. Use the copy sequebce to copy a subset of the line.
    Mouse click down to the executable entry point.
    Press middlemouse to paste, then enter.
    Or press ctly-y and enter.
    Either of these two will execute the thing you pasted.
    You could have edited the line before hitting enter.
26. Copy and paste work well across buffers and the console is just
    another buffer in this sense.
    One problem is that cut & paste of a block INTO the console is broken.
