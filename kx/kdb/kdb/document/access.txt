k db ... -o      for readonly

admin can control access with two system tables:

user:([user]password)
(if there is no user table everyone is allowed)

access:([access,var,user])
(if there is no access table everything is allowed)

client:
 http://user:password@host:port/?query
 KDBC:	h:3:`host,port; h 4:"user:password"
 ODBC:	DBQ=//host:port;UID=...;PWD=...
 JDBC:	Properties p=new Properties;p.put("user",...);p.put("password",...);
        Connection c=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:kx://host:port",p);

admin(load script and server console) can do anything including k.
views and stored procedures can do anything given 'select' access.

the administrator can manipulate 'user' and 'access' 
like any other tables or add to 'access' with grant.

$grant all|{select|update|delete|insert}'s on all|var's to all|user's

for example,

$grant select on all to all
$grant all on t to all
$grant all on all to paul
$grant insert on all to mary
$grant update,delete on u,v,w to mary,peter

admin tool: show'access'

$grant save on all to mary	# for save/checkpoint access
