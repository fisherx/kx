there are two things that can kill a k/db server:

1. disk full.  FIX: more disk

2. ws full.  FIX: controlled access (stored procedures)

k reports: wsfull(heap) or  execformaterror(mmap)

workspace is shared between k/malloc/heap and mmap.
both are complex and fragment.
heap allocation is powers of 2.
heap fragmentation is as much as a factor of 4.
mmap fragmentation can be worse.
generally max column depth is 67MM.(536MB)

nt/w2000	<2GB
w2000AS /3GB	<3GB
linux3		3GB
solaris		4GB

 it is fairly easy to hit this limit with today's machines.
 in general, it is impossible to protect against wsfull.
 (kdb is a turing machine. this would be solving the halting problem.)
 in practice, production servers must have controlled access.


debugging is on by default(-e to errortrap)

common sql(.s) and ksql(.t) errors ...

1. continuation, e.g.

select ...
from ...	# ERROR: needs indentation 

a:2+3
 b:5		# ERROR: needs no indentation

2. ',' separators, e.g.

t:([a:...],	# ERROR: needs no trailing ','
 b:...		# ERROR: needs trailing ','
 c:...)		

3. reserved words, e.g.

end:2		# ERROR: reserved

4. SQL92:   $select g's,a's from t group by g's

the groupby phrase must match the select prefix

some reported errors:

rank - indexing a table that isn't keyed
index - lose connection to the database server
type - insert or update types don't match
