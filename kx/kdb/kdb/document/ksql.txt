order and function.

in RDBMS, "relation" is an unfortunate term.

1. it is wrong. in general sql tables are not relations.
selects on relations often return non-relations.
e.g. select part from partsupply

sql92 gingerly treats tables as multisets.
(select union intersect except join ...)

sql92 is careful to remove ORDER BY from the select.
(put the embarrassment outside the language in the cursor.)

what if we embrace order? time-series analysis is easy.

select ytdsales:sums sales from t
select sales:deltas ytdsales from t

2. it is misleading. keyed relational tables are functions. 
what if we embrace functions? roll-up is easy.

Most equi-joins and outer-joins are eliminated.

All joins in the complex tpc-d queries disappear., e.g. tpc-d query 8

... from lineitem where order.customer.nation.region='AMERICA' ...

a natural index accesses a table/type with a field of that type.

order.customer.nation.region is four natural-indices in a row.

lineitem has field order which is of table/type order which
has field customer which is of table/type customer which ...
(fields have default eponymous type.)

selects can disappear as well ... 

rolodex['john'].phone       instead of

select phone from rolodex where name='john'
