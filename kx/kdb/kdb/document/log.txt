>k db x.kdb -l

loads x.kdb (applies log) and will synchronously append
further update operations (_t;user;message) to x.kdb 



periodically(e.g. when the log hits 1GB or end-of-x)

>save''

synchronously save database to x.kdb



if we have stored procedures (and/or views):

put schema(data) in x.kdb
put funcs and views in x.t

then:

>k db -l x.t

will also load x.kdb (and log updates to x.kdb)

>save''

will save data to x.kdb (and not funcs and views)
