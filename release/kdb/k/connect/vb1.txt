you enter vb studio, and define a "project".

A project is a set of forms and modules.  A
form is a window.  A module is a set of 
procedures, functions, and variables.

Let one of those modules be k.bas, which consists
of the single line:

    Declare Function k Lib "k20" (s, ParamArray a())

This declaration adds a new function to the set
of "primitives" available within the project.

At any point, you can call k as a "set"

        k "foo",a,b,c

which calls the k function foo with vb arguments
a,b,c, or as a "get"

        r=k("goo",a,b,c)

which calls goo on a,b,c and returns r.

K maps all datatypes -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 to 
corresponding vb datatypes, and back again.
