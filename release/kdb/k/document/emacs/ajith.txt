(i) downloaded NTEmacs from the http://www.mozart-oz.org website - a one
step process;
(ii) from the Windows taskbar ran the downloaded file to install Emacs;
(iii) using Windows Explorer, created a desktop shortcut to Emacs;
(iv) right clicked the desktop icon for Emacs to select the "Properties"
menu item and then appended the recommended color options to the "Target
line"; 
(v)copied the .emacs file from the K website to my directory; and
(vi) double-clicked the Emacs icon on the desktop and within Emacs typed
escape, x, shell, enter and typed K as recommended. It worked! (At least
most of the time, it worked - my unfamiliarity with Emacs accounts for the
times when it did not work, as I am not always certain which buffer is
active.)

I see from the various postings that the consensus of the K experts is to
move away from Emacs and use a combination of simpler Windows
tools/techniques. Well, I will try out Emacs for a while at least - the
integration of editing and executing code within one environment seems worth
testing out further.
