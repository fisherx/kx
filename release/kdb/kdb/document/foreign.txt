foreignkey pointer chasing.

this is a big advantage of ksql over sql92. 
when selecting a foreign key the user can 
see through to all related information.

e.g. mouse-click to ...

select sum amount 
 by stock.industry, date.month 
 from trade

the sql92 would be:

select industry, month1, sum(amount)as amount from(
 select stock.industry as industry, 
        extract(month from trade.date)as month1, 
	trade.amount as amount
  from trade, stock where trade.stock = stock.stock)as temp
 group by industry, month1
