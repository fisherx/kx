SCALABILITY

A standard for databases up to 2GB/UNIX or 1GB/NT.
B shuffle for columns up to .25*RAM. no limit on database.
C parallel has no limit.

queries (search, sort, summarize) run at several million records per second. 
kdb is indifferent to the number of fields in tables.
kdb is usually indifferent to the number of tables in queries.
 e.g. tpc-d query 8 is a 9-way join. kdb executes linear to lineitem size.
kdb(parallel) runs almost as fast from disk as from memory.

record lookup is constant or log depending on hash or sort respectively.
aggregation is linear in table length or linear in subselect if sort applies.

update:
linear in size of the transactions. indifferent to database size.
between minimum and inverse sum inverses of network, memory and disk rates. 

bottom line:	kdb scales
