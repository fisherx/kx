on thursday jan 4, 2001 steve miano, ed bierly, keith mason and i
loaded 2.5 billion trades and quotes on a 50cpu linux cluster.

simple table scans on one billion trades, e.g.

select distinct sym from trade
select max price from trade

take 1 second

multi-dimensional aggregations, e.g.

/ 100 top traded stocks
100 first desc select sum size*price by sym from trade

/ daily high and close
select high:max price, close:last price by sym, date from trade

take 10 to 20 seconds

translating the data from TAQ to kdb took about 5 hours.
(steve had loaded the 200 TAQ cd's onto several disk drives.)

distributing the 100gigabytes over the 100Mbit ethernet took 3 hours.
(this cluster should probably have Gbit ethernet)

loading the database (k db taq.m -P 2080), starting 50 slaves,
connecting, mapping shared indicative tables over nfs, building
parallel partitions, etc. took .1 second.
